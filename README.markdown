### Starting on the Mobile Web with Responsive Web Design (RWD)

The directories here that begin with numerals represent subsequent steps of the Splendid Walrus site as the learner moves through the chapter exercises.

#### How to Use: Chapter ZIP file or `chapter1` directory on <hf-mw.com> (normal mode)
Everything you need for completing the exercises in the chapter is contained in the `chapter1.zip` file, which is an archive of the `chapter1` directory.

#### How to Use: Build from repo source (expert mode)
Execute the `build.sh` script; it will spit out a `chapter1` directory and also a ZIP archive of same. This is the starting point for the exercises in the chapter. You can then use `chapter1` exclusively and ignore everything else.
